# Notes/Questions

## Chapter 1

- Why does my `_strlen` function not work correctly?
- Are there classes in C?
- How can I dynamically call a function?
- Naming conventions for variables a short and unreadable
- naming conventions for functions are too short. Why not camelCase or underscore?
- A lot of implicit behavior `for(i = 0; str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9'; ++i)`
  - You depend on knowing that the end of a string is not '\0'
- The difference between strings and chars: "" and ''
- how primitive it is: no classes
